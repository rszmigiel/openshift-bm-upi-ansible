=======
Ansible playbook to spin-up baremetal UPI OpenShift installation environment.
=============================================================================

The purpose of this playbook is to reduce amount of time required to perform
installation of Red Hat OpenShift on baremetal servers using **U**ser
**P**rovisioned **I**nfrastructure (*UPI*) method. It follows the official
OpenShift installation guide available at:
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.8/installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-bare-metal.html

:toc:

= Environment

The following diagram describes the environment configuration at its initial
stage, before installation starts. For further details/requirements please read
the next paragraph.

image::diagram-start.png[Initial setup diagram]

= Requirements
. Valid Red Hat OpenShift subscriptions
. Valid Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscriptions
. Access to https://cloud.redhat.com
. Pair of *activation key* and *organisation ID* to register servers with Red
Hat (https://access.redhat.com/articles/1378093)
. Provisioning host
  .. Preinstalled RHEL 8
  .. 8 CPUs
  .. 16GB of memory
  .. 100GB of free disk space
  .. Connection to _baremetal_ network through *bridge* interface - as described
  at the diagram above
  .. Valid RHEL subscription with access to Red Hat packages
. Provisioning VM
  .. Valid RHEL subscription with access to Red hat packages
. Three master nodes
  .. PXE boot configured on NIC connected to _baremetal_ network
. Two worker nodes (optional)
  .. PXE boot configured on NIC connected to _baremetal_ network

= Extra customization

For additional customisation options please review and edit the following
templates:

. _roles/provisioning_vm/templates/install_config.yaml.j2_ - https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.8/installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-bare-metal-network-customizations.html#installation-configuration-parameters_installing-bare-metal-network-customizations
. _roles/provisioning_vm/templates/autoboot.ipxe.j2_ - https://ipxe.org/scripting

= Installation procedure
. Install RHEL8 on the _provisioning_ host
. Collect a list of MAC addresses from the NICs configured for PXE boot on all cluster
nodes (masters and workers)
. Download RHEL8 qcow2 image from https://access.redhat.com/downloads and store
it as _/var/lib/libvirt/images/rhel-8-x86_64-kvm.qcow2_, for an instance:
+
```
curl -L 'https://access.cdn.redhat.com/content/origin/files/(...)' -o \
/var/lib/libvirt/images/rhel-8-x86_64-kvm.qcow2
```

. Configure network *bridge* connected to _baremetal_ network
.. If you're using the same physical NIC for SSH connection to the
_provisioning_ host, this will interrupt your connection. You may have to
perform the following operation using out-of-band management interface/console
.. You have to remove IP configuration from NIC before you add it to the bridge,
then the IP address has to be configured on the top of bridge interface
.. Update the NIC name (eth0) and IP address in the snippet bellow accordingly
to your configuration

+
```
# nmcli connection add ifname baremetal type bridge con-name baremetal \
ipv4.method manual ipv4.address 192.168.234.2/24 ipv6.method disabled \
ipv4.dns 8.8.8.8 ipv4.gateway 192.168.234.254
# nmcli con add type bridge-slave ifname eth0 master baremetal
```

. Copy this repository to the system which can access provisioning host and has
ansible-playbook binary available. It can be provisioning host itself. +
The following extra packages are also required on the Ansible's controller:
.. python3-netaddr.noarch
.. python3-dns
. Download your pull-secret.txt file from https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create/local
and put it to _files/pull-secret.txt_
. Create configuration file _config/vars.yaml_ - please see
_config/vars.yaml.example_ for the blueprint - it should be pretty
self-explaining
.. `rhn` put your Red Hat's access details (activation key, organization ID)
and the pool name. For more details please see:
 ... https://access.redhat.com/solutions/253273
 ... https://access.redhat.com/solutions/253273
.. `cluster` configure cluster version, name, domain, ingress and API IP
addresses, NTP servers IP addresses.
.. `cluster.networkType` configure what SDN solution should be used,
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.8/networking/openshift_sdn/about-openshift-sdn.html[OpenShiftSDN]
or
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.8/networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/about-ovn-kubernetes.html[OVNKubernetes].
.. `nodes.ipxe_image` name of the iPXE image, please see
https://ipxe.org/appnote/buildtargets for details how to find the right iPXE
image to boot from
.. `nodes.masters` put a list of MAC addresses for PXE booting NIC on master
nodes - order does matter
.. `nodes.workers` put a list of MAC addresses for PXE booting NIC on worker
nodes - order does matter. If you're not deploying any worker nodes, please set
it to `workers: {}`
.. `baremetal_network` the "main" network configuration, including IP, DNS, DHCP
ranges configuration - adjust it to your environment
.. `provisioning_vm` configuration of provisioning VM where the installation tool
will be run from. It also host DHCP server for baremetal network (dnsmasq),
haproxy for load balancer of API and ingress endpoints. Please ensure it has the
right IP address configured and path to its qcow2 image. You may want to change
the default root password.
.. `bootstrap_vm` configuration of temporary bootstrap VM, ensure its qcow2
image path is valid, the other defaults should be just fine.
. Update inventory.yaml file to reflect your IP configuration for provisioning
host and provisioning VM. It has to be consistent with the IP addresses
configured earlier in _config/vars.yaml_ file
. For additional customisation options please review and edit the following
templates:
.. _roles/provisioning_vm/templates/install_config.yaml.j2_
.. _roles/provisioning_vm/templates/autoboot.ipxe.j2_
. Run the installation playbook
+
```
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml main.yaml
```
. Once successfully finished, the environment should be looking as at the
following diagram
+
image::diagram-end.png[End of deployment diagram]

. Now you can power on the baremetal nodes, assuming they will boot via PXE and
you're provided the right MAC addresses to the config file, nodes should be
bootstrapped with the right roles assigned.
. You can continue at https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.8/installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-bare-metal.html#installation-installing-bare-metal_installing-bare-metal

= Establishing connection to OpenShift UI (Virtualized environment)
If you deploy OpenShift using this method in virtualized environment, with
single powerfull host only and VMs as masters/workers nodes, you can create
SOCKS5 proxy with your ssh client in order to reach OpenShift resources via
web browser.
```
ssh root@your_host -D localhost:12345
```
Then configure your browser to use SOCKS5 proxy at localhost:12345

= Cleaning up
To clean up the environment please use cleanup.yaml playbook:
```
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml cleanup.yaml
```
